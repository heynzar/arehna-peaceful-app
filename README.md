## üéØ Goal

Every day, I found myself searching for beautiful Quran recitations on one side, and the relaxing sounds of nature on the other.

This daily ritual inspired me to create something unique: a web application that would bring these two sources of peace together.

That's how Arehna was born, and it turned into something far more beautiful than I had ever imagined.

In those moments when you need to recharge, find tranquility, or simply breathe ‚Äì Arehna is there to help you discover that perfect state of serenity. It's your companion for finding peace, whenever and wherever you need it.

This is meant to replace your usual way of listening to things. It gives you a peaceful mix of sounds that's good for your mind, heart and your soul.
